# Project Overview

This is a minimal Python project containing a single "Hello World" script. The repository consists of one file that demonstrates basic Python execution.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

**Architecture Type**: Single-file Python script
**Runtime**: Python 3
**Execution Model**: Command-line script

The project follows the simplest possible Python architecture - a standalone script that can be executed directly from the command line.

## Key Components

### Core Components
- **index.py**: Main entry point script that prints "Hello World" to console
  - Uses standard Python print function
  - Includes proper shebang for Unix-like systems (`#!/usr/bin/env python3`)
  - Follows Python best practices with `if __name__ == "__main__":` guard

### File Structure
```
/
├── index.py (main script)
```

## Data Flow

1. Script execution begins at the `if __name__ == "__main__":` block
2. `print("Hello World")` sends output to stdout
3. Script terminates

**Input**: None
**Output**: Text string "Hello World" to console
**Processing**: Direct print statement execution

## External Dependencies

**Python Standard Library**: Uses only built-in Python functions
**Third-party Libraries**: None
**System Dependencies**: Python 3 interpreter

The script has no external dependencies beyond a Python 3 runtime environment.

## Deployment Strategy

**Deployment Type**: Direct script execution
**Requirements**: Python 3 interpreter
**Execution Command**: `python3 index.py` or `./index.py` (if executable permissions set)

### Deployment Options
1. **Local execution**: Run directly on any system with Python 3
2. **Container deployment**: Can be containerized with a Python base image
3. **Cloud platforms**: Compatible with any Python-supporting platform

The minimal nature of this script makes it highly portable and easy to deploy across different environments.
